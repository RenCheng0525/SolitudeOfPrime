## **Overview**
**Solitude of Prime** is an interactive mathematical visualization that explores the relationships between numbers through their prime and common factors. Using **HTML5 Canvas**, the simulation dynamically animates numerical interactions, where numbers attract or repel based on their divisibility.

## **Features**

### **Mathematical Simulation**
- **Prime Number Isolation**: Prime numbers, having only two factors (1 and itself), do not attract others and tend to remain isolated.
- **Factor-Based Attraction**: Numbers with common factors experience gravitational attraction, forming dynamic clusters.
- **Mutual Repulsion**: Coprime numbers repel each other, preventing unwanted overlap and creating visually interesting patterns.

### **Visual Effects**
- **Dynamic Number Movement**: Each number is a moving particle, responding to mathematical forces in real time.
- **Distinct Prime Highlighting**: Prime numbers are colored in grayscale to symbolize their solitary nature.
- **Factor-Based Coloring**: Non-prime numbers are assigned colors based on the number of divisors, providing a vibrant representation of their mathematical properties.

### **Interactive Controls**
- **Adjustable Forces**: Modify attraction, repulsion, damping, and particle size through an interactive control panel.
- **Randomized Positioning**: Click a button to shuffle the initial positions of all numbers, creating unique formations each time.
- **Real-Time Updates**: All adjustments take effect immediately, making it easy to experiment with different mathematical behaviors.

### **Technical Highlights**
- **Canvas API**: Handles efficient rendering and real-time animation.
- **Physics-Based Movement**: Uses velocity, damping, and force calculations for natural motion.
- **Mathematical Computations**:
  - Efficient prime and factor detection algorithms.
  - Custom logic to determine attractive and repulsive interactions.

### **Use Cases**
- **Mathematical Exploration**: A fun way to observe the behavior of numbers in a visual and interactive manner.
- **Educational Tool**: Helps students and enthusiasts understand the nature of primes, factors, and coprime relationships.
- **Algorithmic Experimentation**: A foundation for testing different force-based numerical interactions.

## **Browser Support**
- Compatible with modern browsers supporting the **Canvas API**.
- Works on both **desktop and mobile** devices.
